WhereNext is a points-of-interest suggesting Android application that learns about your preferences and tailors its lists to you. This app can keep track of which locations you pay attention to and which you ignore, making sure to always suggest locations you're interested in. You can choose a category to focus on, or simply allow WhereNext to think for you.

WhereNext gives information about specific locations, such as an address, a phone number, a website, etc. You can even view events occurring at that location. Your interest in a location is then noted and used to suggest more points-of-interest.

WhereNext keeps track of the time of day as well, meaning that your preferences during a particular time are saved. Thus, a list of restaurants will be available for you at lunchtime, or a series of supermarkets for weekend shopping.
